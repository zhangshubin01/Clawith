# Clawith Architecture Specification

This document describes the current high-level architecture of Clawith based on the latest codebase. It is intended to help developers quickly identify the system's primary runtime paths, storage model, extension points, and frontend/backend boundaries.

---

## Module 1: System Overview

Clawith is a multi-tenant agent collaboration platform. The product is not just a chat UI: it combines native WebSocket-driven agents, autonomous trigger-based wakeups, external OpenClaw nodes, multi-channel IM ingress, workspace file operations, MCP-based tool import, enterprise directory sync, and a growing OKR subsystem.

### 1.1 Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python 3.11+, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy 2 async ORM, PostgreSQL, httpx, Loguru.
- **Frontend**: React 19, Vite 6, TypeScript, React Router 7, Zustand, TanStack React Query, i18next, Recharts.
- **Realtime**: WebSocket chat streaming for native agents; additional long-lived background managers for Feishu, DingTalk, WeCom, and Discord.
- **Extension Surface**: Built-in tools, MCP tools, skill packages, AgentBay environments, public published pages, and OpenClaw gateway nodes.

### 1.2 Application Startup and Assembly

The backend entry point is `backend/app/main.py`.

On startup, the app currently does the following:

1. Configures logging and middleware.
2. Ensures database tables exist by importing all models and calling `Base.metadata.create_all()`.
3. Seeds default tenant data, builtin tools, templates, skills, default agents, and the OKR Agent.
4. Starts core background tasks:
   - `trigger_daemon`
   - `feishu_ws_manager`
   - `dingtalk_stream_manager`
   - `wecom_stream_manager`
   - `discord_gateway_manager`
5. Registers a broad route surface covering auth, agents, enterprise admin, tools, skills, notifications, pages, gateway, Aware triggers, chat sessions, AgentBay control, and OKR.

This means `main.py` is both a router composition root and an operational bootstrapper.

For OKR-specific startup patching, the bootstrap path now also self-heals missing builtin OKR tool rows before patching existing OKR Agents. This prevents prompt/tool-list mismatches where an OKR Agent mentions `upsert_member_daily_report` in context but does not actually receive the tool in its callable LLM tool set.

The Docker backend entrypoint (`backend/entrypoint.sh`) performs an additional bootstrap sequence before Uvicorn starts:

1. Imports the model graph and runs `Base.metadata.create_all()`.
2. Applies a small list of legacy additive schema patches (`ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`, plus one partial index).
3. Runs `alembic upgrade head`, but logs and continues if migrations fail.
4. Starts `uvicorn`.

Because development and upgrade environments may still have another backend serving traffic against the same database, the additive patch phase now executes each statement in its own short-lived transaction with a `lock_timeout`. This prevents startup from hanging indefinitely while waiting for `ACCESS EXCLUSIVE` table locks on hot tables such as `users`.

### 1.3 Directory Map

#### Backend (`backend/app/`)

- `api/`: FastAPI route layer.
  - `websocket.py`: native agent runtime entry for streaming chat and tool-calling.
  - `gateway.py`: OpenClaw edge-node poll/report/send channel.
  - `triggers.py` / `webhooks.py`: Aware trigger configuration and public event ingress.
  - `enterprise.py` / `admin.py`: tenant admin, SSO, model pool, org sync, platform settings.
  - `tools.py` / `skills.py`: tool registry and skill registry management.
  - `pages.py`: authenticated page publishing APIs plus public `/p/{short_id}` serving.
  - `agentbay_control.py`: human Take Control session APIs for AgentBay browser/computer environments.
- `models/`: SQLAlchemy ORM definitions.
- `services/`: runtime logic, prompt assembly, agent tooling, trigger daemon, MCP resource discovery, org sync, quota guard, OKR services, AgentBay clients, and workspace collaboration helpers.

#### Frontend (`frontend/src/`)

- `App.tsx`: route composition and auth bootstrap.
- `pages/AgentDetail.tsx`: primary agent work surface; chat, settings, sessions, tools, triggers, files, and realtime rendering all meet here.
- `pages/Dashboard.tsx`, `pages/Plaza.tsx`, `pages/Messages.tsx`, `pages/EnterpriseSettings.tsx`, `pages/OKR.tsx`: major product views.
- `services/api.ts`: HTTP client layer.
- `stores/`: Zustand auth and UI state.
- `index.css`: global theme, shared layout primitives, and key animations.

---

## Module 2: Core Data Model

The database model is intentionally broad because Clawith spans SaaS tenancy, agents, collaboration, extensibility, publishing, and enterprise admin.

### 2.1 Tenant, Identity, and Organization

Primary models:

- `Tenant`: company boundary, activation state, SSO-related flags, tenant-level defaults.
- `User` and `Identity`: human account and identity record pairing.
- `IdentityProvider` and `SSOScanSession`: tenant-bound or global authentication/SSO providers and temporary QR/scan login sessions.
- `OrgDepartment` and `OrgMember`: synced enterprise directory/cache for people and department lookup.
- `TenantSetting` and `SystemSetting`: tenant-level or platform-level configuration storage.
- `InvitationCode`: invite-based user onboarding and admin bootstrap.

This layer supports web auth, SSO login, enterprise directory sync, tenant-specific configuration, and invitation-driven company setup.

Important invariant:

- Any tenant-scoped human `User` who becomes a member of a company through registration, company self-creation, or invitation-based joining should also have a corresponding `OrgMember` record in that tenant. Channel-synced members may supply that record from an external provider; otherwise the platform creates a local provider-less `OrgMember` as the canonical relationship/search entry for agent relationship management and OKR tracking.

### 2.2 Agent Runtime Entities

Primary models:

- `Agent`: the main digital employee entity.
  - Important fields include `agent_type`, `primary_model_id`, `fallback_model_id`, `status`, heartbeat settings, autonomy policy, tenant ownership, and system-agent flags.
- `Participant`: universal sender/receiver identity used to normalize humans and agents in messaging.
- `ChatSession`: conversation container for web chat, channel conversations, trigger reflection sessions, A2A sessions, and group sessions.
  - Platform sessions now distinguish a long-lived primary thread (`is_primary=true`) from temporary side-topic threads.
  - Platform-user unread state is tracked per session via `last_read_at_by_user`.
- `ChatMessage` (stored in `audit.py`): the durable event log for user messages, assistant replies, tool calls, and runtime outputs.
- `AgentCredential`: encrypted per-agent session-cookie storage used by integrations such as AgentBay Take Control cookie export and browser-state reinjection, without persisting third-party usernames or passwords.

The messaging layer is deliberately more general than ordinary user/assistant chat, because the same persistence path supports web UI, IM channels, A2A, and trigger-driven reflection sessions.

### 2.3 Extensibility, Workspace, and Publishing

Primary models:

- `Tool` and `AgentTool`: global/tenant tool registry plus per-agent assignment and config overrides.
- `Skill` and `SkillFile`: skill package registry and multi-file skill content.
- `WorkspaceFileRevision` and `WorkspaceEditLock`: file revision history and short-lived human editing locks for agent workspaces.
- `PublishedPage`: public HTML publishing metadata for workspace files served via short IDs.
- `Notification`: notification inbox records for users and agents.

This layer is what turns Clawith from a single agent chat surface into a configurable workspace platform with reusable capabilities and publication workflows.

### 2.4 Autonomy and Async Delivery

Primary models:

- `AgentTrigger`: Aware trigger definitions for cron, once, interval, poll, on-message, and webhook wake conditions.
- `GatewayMessage`: delivery queue for OpenClaw nodes that run outside the main backend process.

These models are the foundation for asynchronous execution and agent wake-up behavior without direct human initiation.

---

## Module 3: Native Agent Runtime

The native runtime is centered on `backend/app/api/websocket.py`.

### 3.1 WebSocket Session Bootstrap

When the frontend opens an agent chat:

1. The browser connects to `/ws/chat/{agent_id}`.
2. The backend validates the user, agent access, and usable model selection.
3. It loads or creates the relevant `ChatSession`.
4. It reconstructs recent history, including prior `tool_call` records, into the model-facing message format.
5. It starts a realtime streaming loop back to the client.

This path is used for ordinary web chat, but the same underlying `call_llm()` machinery is also reused by triggers and some background execution paths.

For first-party platform chat, the bootstrap now prefers the user's primary session for that agent. This keeps agent-initiated reminders and ongoing context in one durable thread, while user-created ad-hoc sessions remain temporary.

### 3.2 Prompt Assembly and Runtime Context

Prompt context is built primarily by `backend/app/services/agent_context.py`.

The context builder pulls together:

- `soul.md`
- long-term memory (`memory/memory.md` or legacy fallback)
- a skill index derived from the workspace `skills/` directory
- relationship notes
- runtime system instructions
- special-case injections such as OKR Agent rules or channel-specific capability guidance

The important architectural point is that an agent's behavior is not defined only by database fields. It is also materially shaped by files in its persistent workspace.

### 3.3 Tool-Calling Loop

The core `call_llm()` flow is a bounded iterative loop:

1. Select a primary model, with runtime fallback to the configured fallback model when needed.
2. Stream assistant output.
3. Detect requested tool calls.
4. Execute tools through the agent tool layer.
5. Append tool results back into the conversation context.
6. Continue until there is no further tool call or limits are reached.

Key protections already present in the runtime:

- tool-round limits
- warning injection before limit exhaustion
- hard validation for malformed high-risk tool arguments
- quota checks
- token accounting and estimation fallback when providers do not return usage
- optional vision/media handling via helper services such as `vision_inject.py`

### 3.4 Session Variants Supported by the Same Runtime

The same native engine supports more than one conversation shape:

- direct user-agent web chat
- channel-backed chat sessions
- A2A sessions
- trigger-created reflection sessions
- session resume/history browsing via `chat_sessions.py`

Two first-party session rules are now important:

- agent-initiated platform messages reuse the primary session instead of opening a fresh thread each time
- unread badges are derived from assistant/system/tool messages created after `ChatSession.last_read_at_by_user`
- when the owning platform user is actively viewing that exact session, newly delivered assistant/tool/trigger messages immediately advance `last_read_at_by_user` so the active thread does not show itself as unread
- trigger results are routed to one explicit destination session: a user's primary platform session for user-originated context, the matching A2A session for agent-to-agent context, or only the trigger reflection session for pure system/reflection work
- if a trigger already sends the user-facing platform message via `send_platform_message`, the daemon suppresses the extra trigger recap in that primary session and leaves the full execution trace only in the reflection session

This is why session and participant handling are more complex than a typical one-user/one-bot design.

---

## Module 4: Aware Engine

The Aware engine is implemented primarily through:

- `backend/app/models/trigger.py`
- `backend/app/api/triggers.py`
- `backend/app/services/trigger_daemon.py`
- `backend/app/services/heartbeat.py`

### 4.1 Trigger Types and Evaluation

Current trigger types include:

- `cron`
- `once`
- `interval`
- `poll`
- `on_message`
- `webhook`

`trigger_daemon.py` runs a periodic tick, evaluates enabled triggers, applies cooldown and expiry rules, and groups fired triggers by `agent_id`.

### 4.2 Invocation Flow

When triggers fire:

1. Trigger state is updated before invocation to avoid duplicate fires during long-running LLM tasks.
2. A structured wake context is assembled from trigger name, reason, matched message, focus reference, and webhook payload when relevant.
3. A reflection-style `ChatSession` is created with `source_channel="trigger"`.
4. The native `call_llm()` loop is invoked.
5. Trigger results may be persisted and also pushed back into active user WebSocket sessions as trigger notifications.

This means Aware is not a separate execution engine. It is a structured wake-up layer on top of the native agent runtime.

### 4.3 Heartbeat and A2A Wake Integration

The trigger daemon also coordinates with heartbeat behavior and A2A wake paths:

- periodic heartbeat checks run on a slower cadence inside the same operational loop
- A2A notifications can be converted into synthetic wake contexts
- dedup windows and chain-depth guards help prevent wake storms

The current implementation is therefore closer to a unified autonomy framework than a simple scheduler.

---

## Module 5: OpenClaw Gateway and External Channel Ingress

Clawith has two major non-web ingress families: OpenClaw nodes and IM/workflow channels.

### 5.1 OpenClaw Gateway

`backend/app/api/gateway.py` provides the external node protocol for `agent_type="openclaw"` agents.

The main path is:

1. External node authenticates with `X-Api-Key`.
2. Node polls for pending `GatewayMessage` work.
3. Node runs its local prompt/tool/model flow.
4. Node reports the result back.
5. Backend writes the result into chat persistence and can notify active WebSocket viewers.

This allows Clawith to treat remote machines as first-class execution agents while still using the central session/history model.

### 5.2 Channel Ingress Normalization

The backend includes channel adapters for:

- Feishu
- Slack
- Discord
- DingTalk
- WeCom
- Teams

The integration depth varies, but the architectural pattern is consistent:

1. Receive an external event.
2. Map sender/channel identity into tenant-aware internal records.
3. Resolve or create the relevant `ChatSession`.
4. Convert the external message into normalized internal context.
5. Reuse the same core LLM execution path.
6. Convert the response back into channel-native delivery format.

Feishu is currently the deepest integration, including image ingestion, contact mapping, card-style streaming updates, and tenant-stable identity handling.

---

## Module 6: Tool, Skill, and Workspace Ecosystem

This is one of the most important parts of the system because it defines what agents can actually do.

### 6.1 Tool Registry and MCP Import

Tools are stored in the database and assigned per agent.

There are two main tool classes:

- builtin tools
- MCP-backed tools

Key files:

- `backend/app/api/tools.py`
- `backend/app/services/agent_tools.py`
- `backend/app/services/resource_discovery.py`
- `backend/app/services/mcp_client.py`

Important behaviors:

- builtin and tenant-scoped tools can be managed from the backend API
- sensitive tool config values are encrypted/decrypted through the API layer
- MCP servers can be discovered from Smithery and ModelScope
- imported MCP servers can expand into multiple concrete tools
- agent-level tool assignments can override default/global configuration

### 6.2 Skill Registry and Skill Packages

Skills are separate from tools.

Tools provide callable actions. Skills provide procedural instructions and optional multi-file assets such as:

- `SKILL.md`
- helper scripts
- references
- examples

Key files:

- `backend/app/api/skills.py`
- `backend/app/services/skill_seeder.py`
- `backend/app/services/agent_context.py`

The runtime only loads a summarized index into the prompt by default, then expects the agent to read the full skill file when it becomes relevant.

### 6.3 Workspace Files, Collaboration, and Publishing

Agent workspaces live on disk under the configured agent data directory, but the database tracks collaboration state.

Key files:

- `backend/app/services/workspace_collaboration.py`
- `backend/app/models/workspace.py`
- `backend/app/api/pages.py`

Current capabilities include:

- path normalization and traversal-safe file resolution
- revision history for meaningful writes
- short-lived human edit locks to prevent agent/user collisions
- prompt-level workspace organization guidance so agents inspect existing folders before writing, prefer relevant subfolders over `workspace/` root, and create a new topical folder when needed
- public HTML publishing through `PublishedPage`
- sandboxed public rendering with CSP on `/p/{short_id}`

### 6.4 AgentBay and Take Control

Clawith also supports shared control of remote browser/computer environments through AgentBay.

Key files:

- `backend/app/services/agentbay_client.py`
- `backend/app/api/agentbay_control.py`

The architectural idea is:

- agents can operate browser/computer sessions through tools
- humans can temporarily take over those sessions
- Take Control places a lock so automatic agent actions pause during manual intervention
- cookies and browser state can be exported back into agent-managed credentials

This is a meaningful collaboration layer, not just a thin remote desktop helper.

---

## Module 7: Enterprise and Platform Control Plane

Beyond agent execution, Clawith contains a substantial admin/control plane.

### 7.1 Enterprise Management

`backend/app/api/enterprise.py` is one of the largest and most operationally important route modules.

It currently handles several responsibilities:

- tenant-scoped LLM model pool management
- model test calls and provider registry access
- enterprise info and audit/approval-related endpoints
- identity provider CRUD
- SSO-related settings
- org department/member listing
- org sync trigger endpoints
- invitation-code related enterprise administration

The corresponding services include `sso_service.py`, `enterprise_sync.py`, `org_sync_service.py`, and provider-specific auth/sync adapters.

Company identity now also includes an optional tenant logo managed from the Company Info tab. Logos are uploaded through the tenant API, validated as square images no larger than 1 MB, stored under the configured agent data directory, and exposed as public UI assets through `/api/tenants/{tenant_id}/logo`. The frontend uses the logo in the sidebar workspace switcher and company selection menu while keeping the existing tenant default model setting intact.
### 7.2 Platform Administration

`backend/app/api/admin.py` handles platform-wide control for platform admins, including:

- company listing and creation
- company activation toggles
- platform metrics
- platform-level settings such as self-serve company creation and invitation policies

This layer is conceptually separate from tenant admin. It operates across all tenants.

### 7.3 Notifications and Activity

Operational visibility also includes:

- `notification.py`: user notification inbox and tenant broadcast flow
- `activity.py` and audit log services: historical activity and usage tracking
- quota guard services: message quota, agent creation quota, agent LLM quota, and heartbeat floor enforcement

This means the control plane is not only configuration management. It also includes enforcement and observability.

---

## Module 8: Frontend Architecture

The frontend is not a thin shell. It coordinates routing, auth recovery, realtime chat rendering, enterprise admin surfaces, and workspace-level UX.

### 8.1 Route Topology

`frontend/src/App.tsx` defines the current high-level product routes:

- `/login`, `/forgot-password`, `/reset-password`, `/verify-email`
- `/sso/entry`
- `/setup-company`
- `/dashboard`
- `/plaza`
- `/agents/new`
- `/agents/:id`
- `/messages`
- `/enterprise`
- `/okr`
- `/invitations`
- `/admin/platform-settings`

The app also consumes token handoff in URL parameters for cross-domain tenant switching, while explicitly avoiding collisions with password-reset and email-verification token flows.

### 8.2 AgentDetail as the Main Work Surface

`frontend/src/pages/AgentDetail.tsx` is the most important frontend page.

It is responsible for a broad mix of concerns:

- WebSocket chat streaming
- live tool-call rendering
- session switching
- A2A message display
- trigger/Aware configuration UI
- workspace-related controls
- various agent settings and admin panels

Architecturally, this file functions as the main operating console for a single agent.

### 8.3 State, Theme, and Realtime Rendering

Key frontend patterns:

- Zustand stores hold auth and lightweight global state.
- React Query is available for data-fetching coordination.
- `index.css` centralizes theme primitives, shared animations, and layout tokens.
- The realtime chat UI relies on incremental rendering strategies to avoid repainting the entire message list for every stream chunk.

There are also global UX behaviors such as:

- notification bar rendering from public backend settings
- route guards for auth, tenant setup, and email verification
- auto-reconnect/resend behavior in chat flows

---

## Module 9: OKR System

The OKR subsystem has its own dedicated API surface and service layer and is now a first-class product area rather than a small extension.

Key files:

- `backend/app/api/okr.py`
- `backend/app/models/okr.py`
- `backend/app/services/okr_scheduler.py`
- `backend/app/services/okr_daily_collection.py`
- `backend/app/services/okr_reporting.py`
- `backend/app/services/okr_agent_hook.py`

Current architectural characteristics:

- tenant-level OKR cadence is persisted through OKR settings
- the OKR Agent is seeded and patched at startup
- daily collection and reporting are coordinated through dedicated backend services
- tracked relationships determine who participates in collection/reporting flows
- the OKR relationship sync flow only auto-links company-visible agents; user-scoped private agents are intentionally excluded even if they belong to the same tenant
- human and agent replies are normalized through the OKR Agent's runtime context and tools
- frontend OKR views include period-aware browsing, company reports, and member-level daily report inspection

The OKR subsystem therefore combines scheduled workflow, agent instruction shaping, persistence, and reporting UI.

---

Clawith should be understood as a coordinated system of tenant-scoped agents, persistent workspaces, trigger-driven autonomy, channel adapters, and enterprise control surfaces. When adding new features, the main architectural questions are usually:

- Which tenant boundary does this belong to?
- Does it enter through the native runtime, Aware triggers, a channel adapter, or the OpenClaw gateway?
- Does it belong in workspace files, database models, or both?
- Is it a tool, a skill, a trigger, a published artifact, or a control-plane setting?

Answering those four questions correctly is usually enough to place new code in the right part of the system.

## Changelog

| Date | Summary |
| --- | --- |
| 2026-04-28 | Added the workspace switcher and company logo identity flow. Users can switch companies from the sidebar, create or join companies from a modal, and org/platform admins can upload a square company logo that is stored outside source-controlled files and served through the tenant API. |
| 2026-04-27 | Tightened the OKR relationship sync flow so the tenant-wide "Sync Relationship Network" action excludes user-scoped private agents. Only company-visible digital employees are auto-linked into the OKR Agent's collaborator graph, matching the existing incremental OKR hook behavior for newly created agents. |
| 2026-04-27 | Closed the Plaza interaction path for private agents. User-scoped private agents can no longer browse, post, or comment in Plaza, private-agent-authored Plaza content is hidden from feed/detail/stats, and private-agent heartbeat instructions explicitly forbid Plaza access to reduce the risk of confidential information leaking into shared social surfaces. |
| 2026-04-27 | Aligned relationship-management permissions across the Agent Detail page and relationships APIs so org admins and platform admins can manage agent relationships even when an agent's stored access level is `use`. This fixes production cases where the seeded OKR Agent remained read-only for non-creator org admins despite being company-visible. |
| 2026-04-25 | Improved workspace document conversion and navigation ergonomics: uploaded PDF/DOCX/XLSX/PPTX extraction now emits more structured Markdown with real tables and slide/page sections, Markdown-to-PDF rendering preserves Markdown tables and CJK-friendly styling, and the chat-side file tree now defaults to a focused `workspace/` scope with an explicit `All` switch for root-level agent files. |
| 2026-04-25 | Replaced the Markdown-to-PDF tool's dependency on the external `markdown` package with an internal lightweight renderer so PDF export no longer fails on missing runtime modules, defaulted the chat-side file tree to a collapsed initial state, and paused expensive HTML/PDF iframe rendering while the right sidebar is actively being dragged to reduce preview stutter. |
| 2026-04-25 | Smoothed chat-side HTML preview resizing by suspending expensive iframe auto-fit recalculation while the workspace sidebar is actively being dragged, then recomputing once after drag end. This prevents the live preview pane from stuttering when users shrink or widen the right-hand file tree/history column while an HTML file is open. |
| 2026-04-25 | Expanded the chat-side file tree from the `workspace/` subtree to the full agent root so `soul.md`, `focus.md`, `memory/`, and `skills/` content can be previewed from the same sidebar, normalized uploads/new folders to writable roots such as `workspace/uploads`, added inline plain-text preview support, and switched uploaded office-document extraction companions from `.txt` to `.md` so extracted content is easier for users and agents to refine. |
| 2026-04-25 | Reworked saved HTML workspace previews so the chat-side preview pane now renders them at the real panel width with automatic height measurement instead of scaling the entire iframe. This keeps responsive HTML previews aligned with sidebar width changes and restores much more reliable in-preview interaction for script-driven buttons, tabs, forms, and modal flows. |
| 2026-04-25 | Refined the chat-side workspace preview stack so saved HTML files now render through real inline file URLs for more faithful script-driven interactions, revision history cards compute human-readable diffs from stored before/after content instead of always showing a placeholder, file-tree mode tracks a selected target directory for nested uploads/new folders/deletes, upload progress is rendered inline inside the relevant directory, and CSV/XLSX preview and CSV-to-XLSX conversion now preserve detected delimiter-based table structure with trimmed empty trailing columns. |
| 2026-04-25 | Improved workspace preview fidelity for richer file types: HTML preview iframes now preserve interactive scripts/forms/modals while debouncing draft updates to reduce visual flicker, CSV preview now renders a styled header row, XLSX preview returns structured sheet rows for table rendering, and Markdown-to-DOCX conversion now uses an internal parser so it no longer depends on BeautifulSoup being installed at runtime. |
| 2026-04-25 | Expanded the chat-side workspace preview sidebar so both file-tree and version-history modes support manual width resizing, version history now surfaces revision timestamps in a scrollable list, and file-tree mode exposes direct upload plus new-folder actions rooted in the currently viewed workspace directory. |
| 2026-04-25 | Refined the chat-side workspace preview interaction so switching files during editing now surfaces an explicit save/discard/stay decision instead of silently ignoring the click, and preview pinning now uses a live lock reference so agent-driven workspace, browser, desktop, and code updates cannot steal focus while the user has locked the current file. |
| 2026-04-25 | Expanded the chat-side workspace preview browser so the file tree now includes common image assets and the preview pane can render uploaded images inline, keeping the side-panel workspace view aligned with the main workspace browser. |
| 2026-04-25 | Added explicit workspace preview pinning on the chat side panel and tightened auto-focus behavior so agent-driven workspace drafts, file mutations, browser screenshots, desktop screenshots, and code output no longer steal the right-hand preview while the user is editing a file or has manually locked the currently viewed workspace file. |
| 2026-04-25 | Added streaming workspace draft propagation for tool-call arguments in the WebSocket runtime. While file-writing and document-conversion tools are still streaming their argument JSON, the backend now forwards incremental `workspace_draft` payloads through the LLM call chain so the frontend can preview pending workspace changes before the tool finishes executing. |
| 2026-04-24 | Hardened the Docker backend entrypoint so additive startup schema patches no longer block container startup indefinitely when another backend instance is already serving traffic on the same database. Each patch now runs in its own transaction with a short PostgreSQL `lock_timeout`, allowing locked legacy patches to be skipped safely while the backend continues booting. |
| 2026-04-24 | Updated the OKR tool output so `get_okr` resolves member and agent owner names in tool responses instead of exposing raw owner UUIDs wherever a readable owner label is available, keeping chat-based OKR review aligned with the dashboard naming model. |
| 2026-04-24 | Simplified grouped member OKR presentation in the dashboard so the owner name is shown once at the group header level, while nested objective cards focus on objective titles and KR content without repeating owner badges inside each card. |
| 2026-04-23 | Hardened OKR authorization across the dashboard and agent-tool path. The web OKR dashboard is now admin-only for mutating actions, while chat-driven OKR mutations are enforced in the OKR tools using the actual requesting user's role rather than prompt-only guidance: non-admin requests may only create or modify the requester's own personal OKRs, and company-level or other-member OKRs require an org/platform admin. Permission failures now return explicit `Permission denied` messages instead of ambiguous owner/not-found wording. |
| 2026-04-23 | Tightened OKR editing guidance so `get_my_okr` now returns both `objective_id` and `kr_id`, OKR tool descriptions explicitly prefer `update_objective` and `update_kr_content` for revisions, and the seeded OKR Agent persona/tool assignment now distinguishes revision flows from new OKR creation. Also regrouped member OKRs in the dashboard so multiple Objectives for the same member render under a single owner container instead of appearing as separate top-level blocks. |
| 2026-04-23 | Expanded stored member daily report content from a 200-character summary cap to a 2000-character normalized body, preserved line breaks during normalization, and updated the OKR reports detail view to render full wrapped report text instead of looking artificially truncated. |
| 2026-04-23 | Added a first-party `update_kr_content` OKR tool for regular agents so they can modify their own Key Result definition fields such as title, target value, unit, focus reference, and status, complementing the existing progress-only update path. |
| 2026-04-23 | Hardened relationship management so both human and agent relationships reject duplicate additions in the UI and on the backend replacement APIs, preventing repeated entries from being persisted when an already-linked member or digital employee is selected again. |
| 2026-04-23 | Improved the Enterprise OKR settings control surface so auto-saved changes now expose explicit saving/saved/error feedback, the daily collection card shows the company timezone that drives cron execution, and admins can trigger a one-off daily collection test from the settings page. Also fixed OKR daily collection to resolve fallback user sessions for external-channel members without raising a missing `ChatSession` import error. |
| 2026-04-21 | Clarified human messaging tool selection so platform-labeled relationships should use `send_platform_message`, channel-labeled relationships should use `send_channel_message`, and the runtime now transparently reroutes mistaken channel sends for platform-only users back onto the platform messaging path. |
| 2026-04-20 | Strengthened workspace-writing guidance so agents should inspect existing folder structure before creating documents, prefer relevant subfolders instead of dumping files into `workspace/` root, and create a new topical folder when no suitable location exists. |
| 2026-04-20 | Tightened trigger result routing so trigger replies no longer fan out to every active web session; user-originated results now land in their primary session, A2A results stay in their A2A session, pure reflection work stays in trigger/reflection sessions, and user-facing `send_platform_message` deliveries no longer get duplicated by an extra trigger recap in the same chat. |
| 2026-04-20 | Renamed the first-party proactive messaging tool from `send_web_message` to `send_platform_message`, covering both web and app surfaces, and added startup seeder logic to rename legacy tool rows in place so existing agent assignments keep working. |
| 2026-04-20 | Made OKR Agent startup patching self-heal missing builtin OKR tool rows before assigning tools, preventing `Unknown tool: upsert_member_daily_report` failures on older databases. |
| 2026-04-20 | Added primary first-party chat sessions, per-session unread tracking, and agent sidebar unread counts so proactive agent messages reuse one durable platform thread. |
