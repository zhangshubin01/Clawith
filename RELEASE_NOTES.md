# v1.8.3-beta.2 — A2A Async Communication, Image Context & Search Tools

## What's New

### Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Async Communication — Beta
- **Three communication modes** for `send_message_to_agent`:
  - `notify` — fire-and-forget, one-way announcement
  - `task_delegate` — delegate work and get results back asynchronously via `on_message` trigger
  - `consult` — synchronous question-reply (original behaviour)
- **Feature flag**: controlled at the tenant level via Company Settings → Company Info → A2A Async toggle (default: **OFF**)
- When disabled, the `msg_type` parameter is **hidden from the LLM** so agents only see synchronous consult mode
- Security: chain depth protection (max 3 hops), regex filtering of internal terms, SQL injection prevention
- Performance: async wake sessions use the agent's own `max_tool_rounds` setting (default 50)

### Multimodal Image Context
- Base64 image markers are now persisted to the database at write time
- Chat UI correctly strips `[image_data:]` markers and renders thumbnails
- Fixed chat page vertical scrolling (flexbox `min-height: 0` constraint)
- Removed deprecated `/agents/:id/chat` route

### Search Engine Tools
- New `Exa Search` tool — AI-powered semantic search with category filtering
- New standalone search engine tools: DuckDuckGo, Tavily, Google, Bing (each as own tool)

### UI Improvements
- Drag-and-drop file upload across the application
- Chat sidebar polish: segment control, session items styling
- Agent-to-agent sessions now visible in the admin "Other Users" tab

### Bug Fixes
- DingTalk org sync rate limiting to prevent API throttling
- Tool seeder: `parameters_schema` now correctly included in new tool INSERT
- Unified `msg_type` enum references across codebase
- Docker access port corrected to 3008

## v1.8.3-beta.2 — Bug Fixes

### A2A Chat History Fixes
- **A2A session now shows both sides of the conversation**: when a target agent is woken via `notify` or `task_delegate`, its reply is now mirrored into the shared A2A chat session so the full conversation is visible in the admin **Other Users** tab
- **Removed hardcoded 2-round tool call limit** for A2A wake invocations: agents were hitting the limit before completing basic tasks; they now use their own configurable `max_tool_rounds` setting (default 50)
- **Fixed message loading order**: sessions with many messages (e.g. long-running A2A threads) were only showing the oldest 500 messages; now correctly loads the most recent 500

## Upgrade Guide

> **Database migration required.** Run `alembic upgrade heads` to add the `a2a_async_enabled` column.

### Docker Deployment (Recommended)

```bash
git pull origin main

# Run database migration
docker exec clawith-backend-1 alembic upgrade heads

# Rebuild and restart
docker compose down && docker compose up -d --build
```

### Source Deployment

```bash
git pull origin main

# Run database migration
alembic upgrade heads

# Rebuild frontend
cd frontend && npm install && npm run build
cd ..

# Restart services
```

### Kubernetes (Helm)

```bash
helm upgrade clawith helm/clawith/ -f values.yaml
# Run migration job for a2a_async_enabled column
```

### Notes
- The A2A Async feature is **disabled by default**. No behaviour changes until explicitly enabled.
- The `a2a_async_enabled` column defaults to `FALSE`, so existing tenants are unaffected.
