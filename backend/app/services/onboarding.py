"""Per-(user, agent) onboarding helpers.

The frontend auto-fires a hidden greeting trigger the first time a user opens
an empty chat with an agent. The backend now treats onboarding as a small
ritual rather than a single welcome line:

  - Custom agents are "defined together" with the user, then write durable
    working notes.
  - Template agents already have a job description, so they confirm and tune
    the preset role before writing local calibration notes.

``agent_user_onboardings.phase`` is intentionally small:

  - no row: the greeting has not fired yet;
  - greeted: the greeting fired, and the next real user reply should complete
    configuration;
  - completed: normal chat forever after.

Existing rows are migrated to ``completed`` so established relationships keep
their current behavior.
